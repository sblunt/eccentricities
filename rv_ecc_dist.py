# goal of this file: given
# 1) the ecc posteriors of all RV planets in CLS sample, and
# 2) the completeness contours from completeness.py:
# do the following:
# 1) calculate the pop-level eccentricity distribution for the RV planets in a sma/msini range that overlaps with the imaged planets
# 2) compare the overall pop-level eccentricity distribution for all RV CLS planets to other publications (as a sanity check)
